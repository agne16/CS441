# PokeScraper
Term Project for CS441

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/agne16/CS441/wiki) for all of your glorious needs.

The purpose of this project is to find correlations between data within the Pokemon series.
In particular, we plan to compare a Pokemon's attack/speed ratio to its calculated BMI.

PokeScraper scrapes data from [pokeapi.co](http://pokeapi.co) to get its data.
